# Bank-Application
The application allows us to create and manage bank accounts and store them in a .csv file. In order to access the application, one must provide a valid username and password (both having requirements specified upfront).
The main goal of the application was to make it as optimized as possible, all changes to the database happen in realtime without the need to have the database constantly stored in memory. This was done in order to protect the integrity of the database as much as possible.
Aside from the database being fairly well encapsulated, there is also a fair amount amount of freedom regarding the management of each of our bank accounts.
